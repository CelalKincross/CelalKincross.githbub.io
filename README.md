## General Information
- I have traveled and learned Mandarin Chinese, enough French to complete a year of studies at a Parisan university, and now, enough HTML, Javascript, CSS3 and other technologies to complete this on going portfolio website. I hope this website demostrates my on going and relentless pursuit of knowledge. 

- I started using my Taiwanese name Yang-Lee Young (勇洋理) in place of my birth name John Dall'Olio. So, while the latter is my official name, the former is the name I am most often called and is subsequently on the website favicon.
